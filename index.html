         <p>I produced this documentary in 2021. This documentary focuses on how an elderly holds on to his dream of music and runs his store that repairs musical instruments. It aims to encourage more face-to-face communication in people's busy life, and gives inspiration of life's ordinary and subtle happiness. The documentary was watched by more than 10,000 viewers.<br><br><br></p>

         <p>This is the Disney "Duffy's Friends" microfilm series that I worked on. I worked with six other team members to write the script, shoot, and edit the film. I was mainly responsible for scripting the subplots for the content of the film. I had to think about the order of the characters' appearances, how the character would interact with each other, and choose the scenery to make the film vibrant and full of Disney fantasy. I also assisted with the filming and editing, and the whole project took 21 days in total.<br><br>
